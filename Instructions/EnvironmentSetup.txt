## This file gives instructions on setting up the environment for running experiments using the SDF Code
## Mandatory steps marked by *
#

#Setting up the environment on a local linux-server or Windows Linux subsystem
1) Install python and pip. Update them too (*)
2) Create a virtual environment using virtualenv or pyenv (refer to instructions in python environments below) 
3) Use pip to install all the requirements listed in the requirements.txt 

#NOTE: 
a) When compiling python form source or using tools like pyenv that compile python from source, install lzma and lzma-dev before compilingv
b) Numpy version compatibility needs to be checked (1.19.2) might be the only one
c) No python version compatibility issue related to tensorflow or pandas. But check the documents for the package version you are installing

#Managing multiple python versions and environments using pyenv
#Linux or Linux Subsystems(Windows) 
NOTE: Instructions listed from https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/ 
1) Install pyenv using the installer (curl command) 
2) Add the commands to your bashrc and bash profiles to automatically load the environments when moving into the work folder
# Add pyenv executable to PATH and
# enable shims by adding the following
# to ~/.profile:
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
# If your ~/.profile sources ~/.bashrc,
# the lines need to be inserted before the part
# that does that. See the README for another option.
# If you have ~/.bash_profile, make sure that it
# also executes the above lines -- e.g. by
# copying them there or by sourcing ~/.profile
# Load pyenv into the shell by adding
# the following to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
# Make sure to restart your entire logon session
# for changes to profile files to take effect.
# Load pyenv-virtualenv automatically by adding
# the following to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
3) Create virtual environment <enviornment_name> for the project  
4) Activate virtual environment after moving to the work or project folder
